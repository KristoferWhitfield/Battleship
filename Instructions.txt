Hello commanders welcome to Battleship!

First each player chooses to either have randomly generated game or select where to place your ship.

If player decides to place ships, the player then decides what coordinates to place their ships.
If coordinates are outside the game board, or conflicts with another ship placement, the player
will be prompted again to enter a coordinate.

Player one then selects their coordinates where to fire.

After player one fires, press enter to change turns.

First player to sink all opponents battleships win.
